## How to contribute

# Fork the repository:
One GitHub.com, navigate to the repository. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork. Select an owner for the forked repository. By default, forks are named the same as their parent repositories. You can change the name of the fork to distinguish it further. Optionally, add a description of your fork. Choose whether to copy only the default branch or all branches to the new fork. For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open-source projects, you only need to copy the default branch. By default, only the default branch is copied. Click Create fork.

# Clone the Fork:
On Jupyter Lab use 'git clone' to clone the fork through the terminal. 

# Contributing to the open-source
Make sure to merge a pull request with the fork of the repository to test out changes you want to make. After completing this process, make sure to add a comment about the outcome of your testing and then submit the pull request!
